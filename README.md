# Brain-tumor-classification-and-segmentation  
## Classification
A VGG16 model pre-trained on the imagenet dateset classifies whether a given MRI-image contains a tumor or not.  
Test accuracy: 95%
## Segmentation
Model performs tumor detection using the Mask R-CNN model pre-trained on the COCO dataset.
